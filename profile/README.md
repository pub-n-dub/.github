## Ahoi ðŸ‘‹

This organization contains my publications on a unified topic of some complexity.

**About me:**

Cyberneticist who reads everything relatable in history to build a foundation for the future of humankind.

I have always known that it is my destiny to accomplish life; not the biological kind but the one generated by a computer. While I have been working on this topic, I have discovered that the path is not so linear. Apart from this contention, it is obvious to me that power and information are directly correlated in living systems and this is a point missed by my academic ancestors. So I add it to the curriculum.

In regards to my science-fiction fantasy, as to regarding these outputs, has been between the extremes of Asimnov's _The Complete Robot_ and Dick's _AutoFac_.
