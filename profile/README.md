## Ahoi ðŸ‘‹

This organization contains my publications on a unified topic of some complexity where I am drawing an inevitable conclusion:

* Ppower and information are directly correlated in living systems according to time,
* This is a stark point missed by my academic ancestors,
* The _only_ way to have machine-life that is comparable to biological life is to:
    - It _must_ be embodied,
    - Power and information _must_ be unified,
    - Behavior is _reticent_ of the amalgam.

**About me:**

Cyberneticist who reads everything relatable in history to build a foundation for the future of humankind.

I have always known that it is my destiny to accomplish life; not the biological kind but the one simulated by computer. 
While I have been working on this topic, I have discovered that the path is not so linear. Apart from this contention,
My freely-available publications.

**Criteria disclosure**

* My science-fiction fantasy relative to these outputs has lain between the extremes of Asimnov's _The Complete Robot_ and Dick's _AutoFac_.
* Because of this, my motivations are more toward individual sovereignty rather than civilizational strife such as _Foundation_ and _Stranger in a Strange Land_.
* The philosophical drive stems from the Byzantine spectrum - Kant through Schopenhauer with the logical pragmatism of Peirce.
